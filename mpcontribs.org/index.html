                    <p><b>MPContribs</b> is a platform that enables materials researchers to
                    contribute experimental and theoretical materials data to
                    <a href=https://materialsproject.org>Materials Project</a> (MP). Data on
                    MPContribs is collectively maintained as annotations to existing MP materials
                    and automatically exposed to over 190,000 MP users. MPContribs disseminates
                    contributions as preview cards on MP's
                    <a href=https://next-gen.materialsproject.org/materials/mp-22987>materials details pages</a>,
                    in the form of interactive landing pages on its portals, and programmatically
                    through a <a href="https://pypi.org/project/mpcontribs-client/">python client</a>
                    for its APIs.</p>
                    <p class="mt-4">The table below lists the various MPContribs portals currently available.
                    When you consider contributing your data to MP, please pick the portal that
                    best aligns with it.</p>
