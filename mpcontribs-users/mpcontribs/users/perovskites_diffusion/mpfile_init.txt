description:
Factors controlling oxygen migration barriers in perovskites.
Perovskites with fast oxygen ion conduction can enable technologies like solid
oxide fuel cells. One component of fast oxygen ion conduction is low oxygen
migration barrier. Here we apply ab initio methods on over 40 perovskites to
produce a database of oxygen migration barriers ranging from 0.2 to 1.6 eV.
Mining the database revealed that systems with low barriers also have low
metal-oxygen bond strength, as measured by oxygen vacancy formation energy and
oxygen p-band center energy.  These correlations provide a powerful descriptor
for the development of new oxygen ion conductors and may explain the poor
stability of some of the best oxygen conducting perovskites under reducing
conditions. Other commonly-cited measures of space, volume, or structure
ideality showed only weak correlation with migration barrier. The lowest
migration barriers (< 0.5 eV) belong to perovskites with non-transition-metal
B-site cations, and may require vacancy-creation strategies that involve no
dopants or low-association dopants for optimal performance.
Calculated oxygen migration barriers in 40+ perovskites range from
0.2 to 1.6 eV. The lowest migration barriers are for non-transition-metal B-site
cations. Barriers correlate well with M-O bond strength descriptors for this
database. Barriers do not correlate with many other proposed descriptors for
this database.
