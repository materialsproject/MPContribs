MPContribs - The Materials Project's Community Contribution Framework
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Since its start in 2011, Materials Project (MP, https://materialsproject.org/)
has grown into a world-wide resource for a materials sciences community of more
than 27,000 users who rely on the portal as a trusted source to accelerate
their research. As a result, they wish to help with MP's efforts by
contributing back, but also ask for support in sharing their experimental and
computational datasets alongside MP's curated results. This provides the
opportunity for researchers in both domains to validate calculations or
measurements almost instantaneously and use the disseminated data for
integrated materials studies.

With the public announcement of our general contribution framework, MPContribs,
we present a sustainable solution for well-curated data management,
organization and dissemination in the context of MP. The framework serves the
purpose of collectively maintaining contributions to local and MP community
databases as annotations to existing MP materials. It subsequently disseminates
them through a generic interactive gateway powered by Jupyter notebooks or
through custom project web apps enabled by the webtzite app kit.

Slack channel: https://mpcontribs.slack.com/signup (everyone with a @mit.edu
